# HackAIthon
we made this project primarity on kaggle notebook ;
[link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/booobas/notebook92e1047cb6 ]
We have used pandas, numpy, sklearn 
The code can be run on kaggle notebook itself or any other appropriate environment with required libraries installed 

when the code is run, it asks how many times you want to provide input and then it asks you to provide those inputs as text and gives output as spam or ham
